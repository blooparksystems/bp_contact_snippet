   **Bloopark Contact Snippet.**

This snippet provides a small lead form for embedding on landing pages and other centent pages of your website. It automatically creates a lead in your Odoo Backend.

Installation:
-------------
Just download the complete module and add it to your v8.0 addons folder. After restarting the server update your module list and install the snippet. It is now available in your snippet toolbar of the website builder.

Notes
-----
This addon has been developed and tested for Odoo v8.0. The screenshot shows the snippet with our custom Bloopark theme. It might look different if you have a custom theme installed. All styling is done in Sass and compiled with Grunt, which is why the CSS is minified. If you need help styling the snippet to your needs please don't hesitate to contact us.
